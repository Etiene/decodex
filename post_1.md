# Machine Learning Decodex Part I: Introduction

## What is the Machine Learning Decodex project

I decided I wanted to learn Machine Learning (ML) some time ago. And my way of learning things is making projects with the things I'm trying to learn. I also happen to have an obsession with the book Codex Seraphinianus.

By those who do not know it, Codex Seraphinianus is a book written by Luigi Serafini between 1976 and 1978. According to some, it is one of the weirdest books ever published. The author spoke publicly about it on rare occasions. It consists of some kind of encyclopedia of an alternate reality or different world, beautifully illustrated in surrealist images, written in more than one made-up alphabet in maybe an unknown language. Nobody knows if it is a language or if it even has any meaning at all. We can notice that the book is divided in chapters with sections that could be fauna, flora, tribes, tools etc. by the illustrations. Some have figured out the numbering system of the paging. Multiple linguists have tried to decipher it and failed, discovering maybe some interesting information or patterns. Many years later, Serafini himself said that there is no meaning to it, that he wanted to give readers the same feeling as a small child "reading" a book.

Well, he certainly succeeded in passing this feeling, but I still wonder if there isn't really any meaning at all. Who knows maybe there aren't NSFW jokes or communist propaganda hidden in it!?? C'mon, there must be at least some easter eggs. If there isn't at least one, I'd say wow, Serafini, WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. I was not 100% sure and I couldn't let this go. I spent countless hours searching, going in spirals of personal websites and blog posts of people attempting to decipher it.

I finally managed to get myself a printed copy of this book when I got an Amazon voucher for any book in a Hackathon (Hey Swiftkey, if you ever read this, thank you very much). It's one of my treasures and I love looking at it. One day I realized, woah, but I don't think anybody tried Machine Learning yet! Just to be clear, I had no idea what ML meant at that point, only a rough idea of some of the insane things it could do. And no, I do not have the pretense at all to think I will be successful in deciphering anything. But this was a great occasion to learn ML. Even on the most possible outcome that there isn't anything to it, it's still a fun exercise aligned with my obsession du jour.

The first part was informing myself on the theme. So what is machine learning afterall? I'll try to break it down here, but I have a passive-agressive relationship with Math. I love it but it doesn't love me back. That means please forgive me if I replace the convenient parts with "and then black magic happens".

I started an online course, twice, did not finish. Read buzz blog posts coming on hackernews now and then. Started following what was going on with open-source projects in this area within the community I was closer with, which is Lua (this is when I discovered Torch, a scientific computing framework I'll get into more details later on). Started talking about ML with friends and even with strangers when drunk in pubs!

What I got out of it will be summarized in the next post "So What is Machine Learning"
